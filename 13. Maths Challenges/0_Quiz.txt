    x = x % mod;
    while (y > 0) 
    { 
        if (y & 1) 
            res = (res*x) % mod;;
        y = y>>1; 
        x = (x*x) % mod;;   
    }

1. Title: math matrix expon
Description: If we <b>n</b> times multiply the matrix <b>M</b> to itself (in other words calculate <b>power(M, n )</b>), then we get the <b>(n+1)th</b> Fibonacci number as the element at row and column (0, 0) in the resultant matrix. Matrix M is?

2. Title: math pigeonhole1
Description: Six distinct positive integers are randomly chosen between 1 and 2006, inclusive. What is the probability that some pair of these integers has a difference that is a multiple of 5?

For two numbers to have a difference that is a multiple of $5$, the numbers must be congruent $\bmod{5}$ (their remainders after division by $5$ must be the same).

$0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ are the possible values of numbers in $\bmod{5}$. Since there are only $5$ possible values in $\bmod{5}$ and we are picking $6$ numbers, by the Pigeonhole Principle, two of the numbers must be congruent $\bmod{5}$.

Therefore the probability that some pair of the $6$ integers has a difference that is a multiple of $5$ is 1



3. Title: math pigeonhole2

6. Title: math probabilty - boxes
Description: Initially, you are given 2 boxes, 50 red balls and 50 blue balls. <br>You have to distribute all the balls in the two boxes. After distributing the balls, a box will be randomly selected and randomly a ball will be picked from that selected box. You will distribute the balls in such a way to maximize the chance of picking red ball. Maximum probability of picking the red ball you can get from this scheme is?

This problem is related to the Coin Change problem, which involves finding the largest value that cannot be formed using a specific set of coin denominations. 

This problem can be solved using a mathematical approach called the "Frobenius Coin Problem" or "Chicken McNugget Theorem". The theorem states that the largest integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of non-negative multiples of two coprime integers 

 (in this case, 5 and 11) is given by:

largest impossible value

largest impossible value=m×n−m−n

For your case, 

largest impossible value
39
largest impossible value=5×11−5−11=39
