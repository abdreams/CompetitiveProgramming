Problem Name: FIBOSUM
Problem Difficulty: 
Problem Constraints: 1<=T<=1000
0<=N<=M<=10^9
Problem Description:
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the following relation:

F(0) = 0<br>
F(1) = 1<br>
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), N >= 2
<br>Your task is very simple. Given two non-negative integers N and M, you have to calculate the sum (F(N) + F(N + 1) + ... + F(M)) mod 1000000007.<br><b>Source:</b> [FIBOSUM (SPOJ)](http://www.spoj.com/problems/FIBOSUM/)



Input Format: The first line contains an integer T (the number of test cases). Then, T lines follow. Each test case consists of a single line with two non-negative integers N and M.*/
