   - **Pages:** Home, News, Sectors Information, Portfolio Dashboard, Settings, Login, and Registration.
   - **Components:** Header, Footer, News List, Sector List, Portfolio Table, Portfolio Creation Form, Settings Form, Login/Registration Forms.

2. **Backend API (Node.js/Express)**
   - **Endpoints:** Authentication (login, register, logout), News retrieval, Sector data retrieval, Portfolio CRUD operations, Settings management.
   - **Services:** Handles requests from the frontend, interacts with the database, communicates with the AI model and external APIs.

3. **Authentication (Firebase/Auth0)**
   - **Functionality:** User authentication, secure login and registration, role-based access control.

4. **Portfolio CRUD**
   - **Operations:** Create, Read, Update, Delete portfolios.
   - **Database Interaction:** Stores and retrieves portfolio data from MongoDB/PostgreSQL.

5. **AI Model (TensorFlow)**
   - **Functionality:** Portfolio optimization based on historical price data, risk assessment, and capital allocation.
   - **API Integration:** Exposed as a REST API endpoint in the backend for frontend communication.

6. **External APIs**
   - **Sources:** Financial news, sector performance data.
   - **Integration:** Fetches real-time and historical data for use in the application.

7. **Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)**
   - **Storage:** User information, portfolios, sector data, and other relevant information.
   - **Access:** Backend API interacts with the database to store and retrieve data.

8. **Client Devices (Web Browsers)**
   - **Interaction:** Users interact with the frontend via web browsers to manage portfolios, view news and sector data, and update settings.

### Deployment and Monitoring

- **Hosting:** Cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
- **CI/CD:** Continuous integration and deployment pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Travis CI).
- **Monitoring:** Application performance monitoring (New Relic, Datadog).
- **Logging:** Centralized logging (ELK Stack).
- **Alerts:** Alerting mechanisms for application issues.

This diagram and components overview provide a visual and textual representation of the high-level design, showing how each part of the system interacts to form a cohesive AI-driven portfolio optimization application.
