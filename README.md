For your presentation on the High-Level Design (HLD) of the AI Model for Portfolio Optimization, you should include the following system functional capabilities and non-functional requirements (NFRs) on one slide:

### System Functional Capabilities
1. **Asset Selection**
   - Select assets based on historical performance, sector diversification, or other criteria.

2. **Risk Model Development**
   - Estimate volatility and correlation of asset returns using historical data.

3. **Incorporation of Constraints**
   - Apply minimum/maximum allocation limits, sector exposure limits, and regulatory constraints.

4. **Back-Testing**
   - Evaluate the optimized portfolio allocation against historical data for performance and robustness.

5. **Monitoring and Rebalancing**
   - Continuously monitor portfolio performance and rebalance to maintain the desired allocation and risk profile.

6. **Objective Function Definition**
   - Develop an objective function to quantify the trade-off between return and risk.

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
1. **Performance**
   - The algorithm should perform optimizations within a reasonable time frame, even for large datasets.

2. **Scalability**
   - The system should handle a growing number of assets and increasing data volumes efficiently.

3. **Accuracy**
   - Ensure high accuracy in risk estimations and portfolio optimizations to achieve reliable results.

4. **Transparency**
   - Provide clear insights and explanations for the AI's decisions to enhance understandability.

5. **Data Quality**
   - Ensure high-quality data inputs to avoid "garbage in, garbage out" scenarios.

6. **Robustness**
   - The system should handle black swan events and outliers without significant degradation in performance.

7. **Security**
   - Implement strong data security measures to protect sensitive financial data.

8. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Ensure the system adheres to relevant financial regulations and compliance requirements.

### Additional Considerations
- **Data Challenges**
  - Address issues of insufficient, incomplete, or poor-quality training data.
  - Develop strategies to identify and handle rare events (black swans).

This slide provides a comprehensive overview of the key functional and non-functional aspects needed for the AI Model for Portfolio Optimization, ensuring clarity and focus for your audience.
