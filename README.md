Creating portfolio codes can be a fun yet important task as they often reflect the essence of the portfolio while maintaining a professional tone. Here are suggestions for portfolio codes that correspond to your risk categories:

1. **Shield (Low Risk)**
   - **SHLD-001**
   - **SHIELD-LR-01**

2. **Stable (Moderately Low Risk)**
   - **STBL-002**
   - **STABLE-MLR-02**

3. **Balanced (Moderate Risk)**
   - **BAL-003**
   - **BALANCE-MR-03**

4. **High Growth (High Risk)**
   - **HGRW-004**
   - **HIGHGRW-HR-04**

These codes are short, professional, and clearly indicate the risk category they represent. You can further customize them based on your company's naming conventions or specific requirements.
