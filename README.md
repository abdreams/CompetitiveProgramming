To fix the issue with `globalFilter` not being defined, ensure you correctly manage its state within the `useTable` hook's state. Here are the changes to ensure `globalFilter` is defined and used properly:

1. **Include `globalFilter` in the initial state**:
   When setting up the `useTable` hook, make sure to include `globalFilter` in the initial state.

2. **Retrieve `globalFilter` from the state**:
   Ensure you are accessing `globalFilter` from the state returned by `useTable`.

Here are the specific changes:

1. **Define the initial state in the `useTable` hook**:
   ```javascript
   const {
       getTableProps,
       getTableBodyProps,
       headerGroups,
       rows,
       prepareRow,
       state: { globalFilter }, // Access globalFilter from state
       setGlobalFilter, // Ensure this is included here
   } = useTable(
       {
           columns,
           data,
           initialState: { pageIndex: 0, pageSize: 10, globalFilter: '' }, // Include globalFilter in initial state
       },
       useGlobalFilter,
       useSortBy,
       usePagination
   );
   ```

2. **Use the `setGlobalFilter` from the destructured object in your input's `onChange` handler**:
   ```javascript
   <input
       value={globalFilter || ''}
       onChange={e => setGlobalFilter(e.target.value)}
       placeholder="Search..."
   />
   ```

With these changes, `globalFilter` should be correctly initialized and managed within the table's state, allowing your search input to function properly without errors.
